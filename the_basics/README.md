# The Basics

**Objective:** Make you understand basic concepts about how Git and Python 3.6 work so you can realize what to look for in official documentation or in the web.

This workshop is designed for beginers, if you already know some of the topics I encourage you to come only when you think you'll lern new stuff. After every session I will point with an arrow the topic in which we stopped, this way you can know how if the following topics that we are going to cover are interesting for you or not.
